          <p>
            Your access to and use of
            <a href="https://handsdown.dev">handsdown.dev</a> is subject to the
            following terms and conditions and all applicable laws.

          <h5>Acceptance of Terms.</h5>
          <p>
            The Hands Down project (or "us" or "we") welcomes you to
            <a href="https://handsdown.dev">handsdown.dev</a> and related
            sub-domains (the "Website"). By accessing and using the Website, you
            accept the following terms and conditions, without limitation or
            qualification. Unless otherwise stated, the contents of the Website
            including, but not limited to, the text and images contained herein
            and their arrangement are the property of the Hands Down project.
            All trademarks used or referred to in this Website are the property
            of their respective owners. Nothing contained in the Website shall
            be construed as conferring by implication or otherwise, any license
            or right to any copyright, patent, trademark or other proprietary
            interest of us or any third party.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not use the
            Website. We can change these Terms of Service at any time without
            any notice to you. It is your responsibility to review these Terms
            of Service from time to time for any changes as it creates a binding
            legal agreement between you and us. If you use the Website after we
            have changed any of the Terms of Service, you are agreeing to all of
            the changes.
          </p>

          <h5>Account; Passwords, Security.</h5>
          <p>
            You may need to set up an account in order to use some of the
            features of the Website. You may not use a third party's account
            without permission. When you are setting up your account, you must
            give us accurate and complete information. This means that you
            cannot set up an account using a name or contact information that
            does not apply to you, and you must provide accurate and current
            information on all registration forms that are part of the Website.
            You have complete responsibility for your account and everything
            that happens on your account. This means you need to be careful with
            your password. If you find out that someone is using your account
            without your permission, you must let us know immediately. You may
            not transfer your account to someone else. We are not liable for any
            damages or losses caused by someone using your account without your
            permission. However, if we (or anyone else) suffer any damage due to
            the unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable.
          </p>

          <h5>Personal Use Only.</h5>
          <p>
            We are making the Website available to you for your information and
            personal use only. You may not (and you agree not to) use, copy,

          <p>
            You are solely responsible for any User Content you post to the
            Website, and the consequences of posting or publishing it. By "User
            Content", we mean any Content you post to the Website. "Content"
            means information, data, text, software, music, sound, photos,
            graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or any other
            materials. When we say "post", we include posting, uploading,
            sharing, submitting or otherwise providing User Content in any
            manner in connection with the Website.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unless expressly stated otherwise herein, any User Content submitted
            by you through the Website shall be deemed non-confidential and non
            proprietary. You represent that you have the lawful right to submit
            such information and agree that you will not submit any information
            unless you are legally entitled to do so. Because of the open nature
            of the Internet, we recommend that you not submit information you
            consider confidential.

            submissions with great care. Importantly, without a clear business
            relationship, we cannot and does not treat any such submissions in
            confidence. Accordingly, please do not communicate unauthorized idea
            submissions to us through the Website. Any ideas disclosed to us
            outside a pre-existing and documented confidential business

            and freely disclose or publish similar ideas without compensating
            you or accounting to you. We will make every reasonable effort to
            return or destroy any unauthorized idea submissions without detailed
            review of them. However, if a review is necessary in our sole
            discretion, it will be with the understanding that we assume no
            obligation to protect the confidentiality of your idea or compensate
            you for its disclosure or use. By submitting an idea or other
            detailed submission to us through the Website, you agree to be bound
            by the terms of this stated policy.
